Description:

This is a web page/ webapp which demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL which I made for a class assignment.

It presents as a collection of minigames like paper scissors rock and pickup 52.

Player statistics for paper scissors rock are saved onto a SQL database and the player can view their play statis.

Images of the running webpage can be found in the function screenshots folder.


How to run:

I used XAMPP to run an Apache Web Server and a MySQL database

I've supplied a demonstration version of the database as ArcadeDatabase.sql

In stats.php, processRegistration.php and login.php:
Near the top you'll find:
"// $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "validusername", "validpassword", "ArcadeDatabase");"

Naturally you will need to replace the validusername and validpassword with data relevant to your computer
